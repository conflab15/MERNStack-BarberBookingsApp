# MERN Stack-Barber Bookings App
As part of the UX and Full Stack Development, we were given a transcript of an interview with the client to produce requirements. 
From the transcript, requirements were created, and a Booking System for the client was created using the Mern Stack, which encorporates a RESTful API and MongoDB
to handle and store data, and provide login and registering functionality for users to create and log into their accounts.
The front-end has been implemented using React, to create components and implement a user interface.
